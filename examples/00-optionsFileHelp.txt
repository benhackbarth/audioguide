Options files are a simple series of variables which are defined and written in python's syntax.
VARIABLE1 = 'This is a string'
VARIABLE2 = "This is also a string"
# this is a comment
VARLIST=['this', 'is', 'a', 'valid', 'list']
VARLIST2=[
'this', 
'is', 
'also', 
'a', 
'valid', 
'list'
]

DICT = {1: 2, 4: 2}



Each variable that you write is only definable once; python will always ignore earlier definitions are keep the last one.
VAR1=100
VAR2=30
VAR1=20 # VAR1 will be 20, since the definitin of 100 was overwritten


Several of the variables that you work with in AudioGuide are actually objects with variables and keyword variables.  Keyword variables have default values that are listed in the documentation.

TARGET = tsf('cage.aiff', thresh=-26, offsetRise=1.5)
