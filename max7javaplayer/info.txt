Audioguide player by Gilbert Nouno which works in Max7/8.  Works with the json output (created by default as output/output.json).

To build, make sure java is up to date.  Then:

javac -cp ./json-simple-1.1.1.jar:"/Applications/Max.app/Contents/Resources/C74/packages/max-mxj/java-classes/lib/max.jar": MaxAgJsonOutputReader.java

jar cf MaxAgJsonOutputReader.jar MaxAgJsonOutputReader*.class ./json-simple-1.1.1.jar
